# tensor-lang-parser-loom

`tensor-lang-parser-loom` packages a practical compilers exercise in Julia. The emphasis is on deterministic behavior, a small public API, and examples that explain the tradeoffs.

## How I Read Tensor Lang Parser Loom

The useful thing to inspect here is how the same score rule is represented in code, metadata, and examples. If those three pieces disagree, the audit script should make the drift visible.

## Problem Shape

This is not a wrapper around a service. It is a self-contained project that shows how the model behaves when demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight move in different directions.

## Main Behaviors

- Models source form with deterministic scoring and explicit review decisions.
- Uses fixture data to keep intermediate state changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for bytecode output, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents evaluation checks tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.

## Internal Model

The design is intentionally direct: parse or construct a signal, score it, classify it, and verify the expected branch. This makes the repository useful for studying compilers behavior without needing a service or database unless the language project itself is SQL. The Julia project keeps the model in a small module with assertions in a local test script.

## Repository Map

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Run It Locally

The only required setup is the local Julia toolchain. After cloning, stay in the repo root so fixture paths resolve correctly.

## How To Run It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Validation

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Scenario Walkthrough

`baseline` is the first example I would inspect because it lands on the `review` path with a score of 102. The broader file also keeps `degraded` at -49 and `recovery` at 210, which gives the model a useful low-to-high spread.

## Known Edges

This code is local-first. It makes no claim about deployed usage and avoids credentials, hosted state, and environment-specific setup.

## Follow-Up Work

- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add one more compilers fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
